(https://github.com/bartaz/impress.js/issues/new) to the [issue tracker](https://github.com/bartaz/impress.js/issues).

Pull Requests
-------------

[Pull Requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) should be opened against the [master branch]
(https://github.com/bartaz/impress.js/tree/master). But remember that the team will only accept code that fits the purpose of impress.js.

Guidelines:

* If proposing a feature, make sure to discuss that as an issue first.
* Create a new [topic branch](https://github.com/dchelimsky/rspec/wiki/Topic-Branches) for every separate change you make.
* Make sure impress.js runs successfully on as many browsers as you can test.
